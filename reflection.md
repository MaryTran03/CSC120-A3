Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- N/A

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- TA: Tuesday 7-9pms, Wednesday 7-9pms

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
- I self studied Java 3 years ago, so this wasn't my first time exposed to Java

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- Everything must be an object. This is quite counterintuitive at first especially for the Scanner() and System.out.print. Python was more straightforward in that I can just print out the line using print(). Java uses explicit visibility keywords (public, private), while Python relies on naming conventions for access control.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- I had a hard time setting up JDK. I downloaded the JDK link from RedHat but that didn't work. However, github website for VSC helped
